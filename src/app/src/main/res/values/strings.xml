    <string name="about_this_app_content">This learning application, “TinyTutor,” allows the AI to generate easy-to-work-with four-choice questions with fewer prompts.\nThe questions are generated using the latest version of Gemini Flash developed and provided by Google. The AI also generates the questions in a random format, making it difficult to encounter similar questions. In addition, since the application runs on smartphones and tablets, it is useful when you want to do a little studying anywhere and anytime.\nFurthermore, the generated questions can be saved. You can solve previously generated questions again, and the AI model is always available in its latest version without having to update the app regularly.</string>
